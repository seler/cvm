Introduction
============

What is CVM?
------------

It's a web application, that allows it's users to easily manage, share and publish their resumes.
It allows the user to create multiple identities for the purpose of managing resumes of multiple people, like family or friends. Each identity is able to contain multiple resumes of a person, so that each resume can be created for a specific job application. The user is able to choose a layout for the resume from templates designed by professional graphic artists.

Publication and Sharing
-----------------------

The user is able to generate PDF files for printing or electronic use. The user is also able to publish a resume on the portal or to send a link, allowing the manager to view a resume for a limited period of time.

How CVM works?
--------------

 1. User registers
 2. User creates new Resume
 3. User fills in Resume
    a. User creates or chooses already created Identity
    b. User uploads or chooses already uploaded Photo
    c. Users fills in Sections and Entries
 4. User Shares or Publish Resume
 5. User edits or creates new Resumes
